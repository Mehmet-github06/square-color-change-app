# Square Color Change App

<br />
<div align="center" id="readme-top">

  </a> <br/><br/><br/>

This simple web application features an impressive effect where a square changes color with a random shadow and background color when hovered over.

## How It Works

1. There is a `<div>` named `container` in the HTML file (`index.html`). The JavaScript code dynamically adds squares inside this container.

2. The CSS file (`style.css`) determines the overall layout of the page and styles for the squares.

3. The JavaScript file (`app.js`) creates the squares and performs the color change when hovered over.

## Responsive Design and Photo Section

The application is developed with responsive design in mind. Additionally, it includes the following features:

- Responsive design adapting to screen sizes.
- Proper functionality on both mobile devices and desktop browsers.
